This is a strucuted wiki based on the PHPixie framework. The main idea of this wiki 
compaired to all others is laying a level of structure under the data. For example
each article uses a template and each template is a defined set of sections and attributes.
Every article that uses the same template has the same available sections and attributes to
use, though not all need be used.

The use of templates means the each article about a person has the same sections and attributes 
to it, in the same order and format. If educational information isn't known for a specific person
the section is not shown. Similarly if the birth date isn't known the attribute is not shown.

Each section is defined as a type of data, something simple from text or markup to structured
lists. Eventually other types will be addes such as graphs, data grids, image galleries, etc.
This same idea of types is applied to attributes as well.
